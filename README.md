### About this Project: ###

* I made some routes with nav components, shared components, private/protected route. It is a learning application. There are 6 skills on that application.

* I implemented 3 kinds of authentication systems: email & password sign in, google sign in, github sign in, as well as register. 

* I had to create dataset in server. And I loaded those data dynamically to show in client UI. 

* I used firebase auth and firebase hosting in this project, I also used context API, 

* I made a react-pdf download button to easily download a pdf file. I also made protected route where an user need to be logged in.

* I made a 404 page and used environment variable to hide firebase key.
